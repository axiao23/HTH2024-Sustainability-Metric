# HTH2024-Sustainability-Metric
2024 Hack the Heights Hackathon Project (Sara Rigatti, Audrey Xiao, Elizabeth Garson) 
We generated and created a metric to analyze and produce results for a consumer's grocery list and provide suggestions to improve
their "sustainability" score. This score is generated by comparing a dictionary of brand names to those listed in a grocery list. Each brand name has a corresponding sustainability score which is determined out of ten, (ten meaning the best for sustainability and one meaning the worst.) In addition to giving a score, the program gives suggestions to specific brand names that have the lowest sustainability code. 

The file Hack_the_Heights.ipynb contains all the functions in the program. 

There are separate files in the folder containing specific functions. These funtions are all contained in the main Hack_the_Heights.ipynb file. 

There are two txt files: 1. brands.txt and 2. groceries.txt

- groceries.txt contains an example grocery list that the user uploads which lists the brands separated by the price of the item.
- brands.txt contains the entire list of brands which have sustainability scores which we use to check against the brands of the grocery lists.
